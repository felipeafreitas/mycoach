    """Undo permanent logging mutations so they can't leak into later tests.

    tests/test_migrations/*.py runs real alembic upgrades in-process, and
    alembic/env.py calls ``logging.config.fileConfig()`` on every invocation.
    That call defaults to ``disable_existing_loggers=True``, which sets
    ``.disabled = True`` on *every* logger already registered in
    ``logging.Logger.manager.loggerDict`` that isn't named in alembic.ini's
    ``[loggers]`` section (only root/sqlalchemy/alembic are). Because pytest
    keeps one process for the whole run, this permanently silences
    already-imported application loggers such as ``mycoach.scheduler.jobs``
    and ``mycoach.sources.garmin`` — any later test's ``logger.error(...)``
    call becomes a no-op before a record is ever created, so ``caplog``
    (which relies on propagation to root) sees nothing.

    Snapshotting the whole loggerDict (name -> disabled/level/propagate/
    handlers) is cheap — a shallow dict copy — and is the only reliably
    narrow fix: the set of loggers fileConfig disables is unpredictable
    (it depends on which modules happened to be imported first), so
    restoring only a hand-picked list of "loggers production code touches"
    would not cover it.
