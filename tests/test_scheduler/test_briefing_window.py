"""Tests for the daily-briefing retry window.

Two halves: the decision logic, which is a pure function of a
``BriefingWindow``'s fields and is tested by constructing them directly, and
``load_briefing_window``, which is tested against real ``job_runs`` rows because
the whole point of the design is that the state is nowhere else.
