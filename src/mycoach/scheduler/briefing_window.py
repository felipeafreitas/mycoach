"""What the daily-briefing retry loop should do right now, read off ``job_runs``.

A briefing used to be generated once, at 09:30, and a day where Garmin had not
yet uploaded produced a skip that was both invisible and final. The watch
uploads over Bluetooth only, and even a healthy one lands its data anywhere
between 05:09 and 17:44 — so a single attempt loses roughly one briefing in
five to timing alone, and a backlogged one loses days at a stretch.

The fix is a poll: try every 15 minutes from the configured briefing time,
generate on the first attempt that has usable data, and email the user if the
data still has not arrived an hour in.

**All state is derived, none is held.** Every question this module answers —
"has a briefing succeeded today?", "how many attempts since the window
opened?", "have we already emailed?" — is a query against ``job_runs``, an
append-only table already written on every run. That is a hard requirement
rather than a preference: the scheduler has no jobstore and rebuilds its jobs
from ``create_scheduler()`` on every boot, so in-memory retry state would mean
either a duplicate briefing or a silently dropped window each time the
container restarts. The container did restart mid-incident.
