    """Durable record of a single scheduled-job execution.

    Append-only, and — since the daily-briefing retry window — no longer
    write-only. ``mycoach.scheduler.briefing_window`` derives that window's
    entire state from these rows: whether today's briefing has succeeded, how
    many attempts have been made since the window opened, whether each ended in
    a skip or a real failure, and whether the user has already been emailed.

    That is deliberate rather than convenient. The scheduler has no jobstore and
    rebuilds its jobs on every boot, so anything held in memory is lost to a
    container restart; a table already written on every run is the only place
    the state can live without inventing one. Idempotency for *insights* still
    comes from checking for the insight itself, never from run history.
