Lives in its own module rather than inside the scheduler job that first needed
it, because three callers have to agree on the answer: the retry loop, the
manual generate endpoint, and the dashboard button that offers the manual
endpoint. When the rule lived in the job, the manual path bypassed it — for six
days the dashboard invited the user to press a button that would have produced a
briefing from a snapshot carrying nothing but a display name.
